## Welcome to this repository!
###### heyJohn is a vocal assistant as Google Assistant and Siri.
###### Right now it has only two features:
- It opens Google, YouTube, Gmail, Instagram, Whatsapp, GitHub;
- You can ask him : "How are you?", and he will reply to your question!
- To exit the program say "Quit" or "Exit"

Implemented "Ok John"; "Hey John"" to start talking to him (it won't stop unless you press ctrl+c => fixing)
